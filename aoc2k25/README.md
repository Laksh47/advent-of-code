Advent of Code 2025
====================

This is a basic `uv`-managed Python project for Advent of Code 2025 solutions.

## Usage

- **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)** from the repo root (`advent-of-code`):

```bash
uv venv
```

- **Run a specific solution script** (for example, a `day01.py` you add under `aoc2k25/`):

```bash
uv run python aoc2k25/day01.py
```

- **From inside the `aoc2k25` folder** you can also run:

```bash
cd aoc2k25
uv run python path/to/your_script.py
```
